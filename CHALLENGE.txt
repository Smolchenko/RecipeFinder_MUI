Recipe Finder: 

Build a recipe finder app that lets users search for recipes 
based on ingredients or cuisine. 

You can use an API like Spoonacular to retrieve the recipe data.


IDEA for design -
have 2 button options in the middle of the screen.
Upo selection it'll scroll down to the search (with set up functions
per the selection above)
show an input and a place below to display the recepied 
fetched from the API.


OR a simple input with a dropdown besides it with options:
cuisine / recipes.
